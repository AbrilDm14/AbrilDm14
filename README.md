**Hi, my name is Abril DomÃ­nguez and I'm a Data Analyst** ðŸ‘‹ 

I studied International Business in Manchester Metropolitan University. I have worked as a Project Analyst across various industries including healthcare, retail, travel, food & beverages and more. It was during this journey that I discovered my passion for the world of data. 

In 2023, I embarked on a quest to further specialize as a Professional Data Analyst. During this time, I acquired expertise in essential technologies such as SQL, Python, Tableau and Git to enhance my analytical skills. 

Projet-wise, I am responsible, proactive and detail oriented. Outside of work, I love gaming, F1 racing and spending time with my loved ones.
